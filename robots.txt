
As always I started with discovering of page source

There is nothing interesting here So I tried to find some other weakness I used Dirsearch which is a linux tool used for discovering hidden directories and files on web servers




In the result, only one line was green-successful named robots.txt  so I added it to the url

Then I also added  /g00d_old_mus1c.php to the URL and get flag
