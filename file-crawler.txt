After examining the source code, it appears that the image is being loaded
through a line of code that uses a local file inclusion vulnerability (LFI) in the
image_name parameter. When attempting to exploit this vulnerability by using
a simple payload such as ../../../etc/passwd, an error message appeared
instructing to try harder. This indicates that the application may be filtering
certain characters, such as ../. IUltimately, a payload was discovered that
successfully read the
/local?image_name=..//..//..//etc/passwd file.
/local?image_name=..//..//..//tmp/flag
