Remote code execution
In url - /index.php?vector=/Admin/e&amp;replace=system(‘ls -l’)
Php is vulnerable to something callet preg_replace() so we used it and typed
ls -l to get into its insides where we found here_we_dont_have_flag, which is
very suspicious so we used cat command to look into it.
=/Admin/e&amp;replace=system(ls -l cat here_we_dont_have_flag’)
Here we found out that there is something in it named flag.txt. so we obviously
should access it maybe flag is in there.
=system(‘cat here_we_dont_have_flag/flag.txt’)
