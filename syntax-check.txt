In the description was hint about markup language that can be read by humans as wall by machines only language like this is XML so I searched for XML External Entity (XXE) Injection Payloads 
Then  I open burp suite where I can  modify requests after that I pressed parse button and  turn on intercept 
write /parse?<foo>hi%21<%2Ffoo>=&_token=Euk0...
then send request to repeater where add payload from previous search
After that I get response where was  encoded flag  so I send It to decoder and decode it as a base 64
go to decoder and get flag
